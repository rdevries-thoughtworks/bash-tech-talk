# Why care about bash

???

*Roald*

- It's widely available, even in docker containers
- It's close to how you interact with applications 'manually'
- Hence, everybody knows it (at least a bit)
- Hence, it comes back on every project, hence it's worth investing your time in
- Hence, it's your entry drug into automation

# What's bash anyway?

???

*Roald*

- Bash is a UI to your OS
- And it's automatable
- Bash is a string expansion engine
- But on a higher abstraction level, it's a programming language where applications are functions
- And it *was* patched with some features you might want for scripting
  - functions
  - getopts
  - arrays
  - assoc arrays
  - coroutines
  - shell arithmetic
  - readonly and local variables

# Why is bash not a decent PL?

class:

# Good basic practises

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

main() {
  local environment="$1"

  ...
}

main "$@"
```

Let's unwrap...

# Good basic paractises (cont.)

Put bash into "safe mode".

```bash
set -e

cd /tmp
rm -rf *


set -u

rm -rf "${DIR}/"


set -o pipefail

cat for_deletion | xargs rm
```

# Good basic paractises (cont.)

Limit options to reduce failures: e.g. scope variables

Bash has higher level concepts!

```bash
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

main() {
  local environment="$1"

  ...
}
```

---

# Good basic paractises (cont.)

Follow a predictable style, reduce surprises

```bash
main() {

  ...
}

main "$@"
```

---

# Good basic paractises (cont.)

Always quote, deal with values including spaces
```bash
main "$@"
```

Use shellcheck (https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to tell you about onforseen issues.

# Typical things, and how you want to do them in bash

???

# Typical things: Return values

Oh noes, I cannot return anything apart from integers.

Bash takes strings from the left and shoves them to the right. It's good at that!
But we can play along.

```bash

normalized_filename() {
  local path="$1"
  echo "$path" | sed 's/[ -]/_/'
}

cp "$tmp_file" "$(normalized_filename "$tmp_file")"
```
